# Unreleased

## New Features

### `speechify` plugin: Speechify TTS

Adds a new `speechify` plugin exposing `speechify.TTS`, backed by Speechify's streaming API. It streams raw PCM audio, defaults to the `simba-3.2` model with the `geffen_32` voice, and reads `SPEECHIFY_API_KEY` from the environment. Install with `vision-agents[speechify]`.

### Realtime input audio pacing (#599)

Realtime LLMs that need a steady upstream audio cadence can now opt into framework-level pacing. Pass `input_audio_pacing=AudioInputPacingConfig(...)` to a `Realtime` subclass and the framework buffers the irregular PCM the WebRTC uplink delivers and forwards fixed-size chunks (default 20 ms) at a stable wall-clock rate. `AudioInputPacingConfig.virtual_microphone()` is a preset for speech-to-speech models that interpret gaps in the input as end-of-turn — it primes a 500 ms buffer and fills digital silence on a dry buffer so the model never sees an interruption.

### `gemini` plugin: Live Translate model with auto-enabled input pacing (#599)

Adds `gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview` as a supported Live Translate model and bumps the default Gemini Realtime model to `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` (was `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`). The Live Translate model is sensitive to uneven input audio — irregular upstream chunks produce audible jitter and word-cutoffs in its output. `GeminiRealtime` automatically installs `AudioInputPacingConfig.virtual_microphone()` whenever the model is `gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview`, so the framework feeds it a steady 20 ms stream by default. Opt out with `input_audio_pacing=None`.

### `getstream` plugin: non-blocking StreamConversation persistence (#589)

`StreamConversation` now persists messages to Stream Chat in the background instead of awaiting each REST round-trip inline. Voice pipelines call `upsert_message` on the critical path (per transcript and per LLM delta), where the inline ~150–300 ms round-trip compounded into audible response latency. Writes are dispatched as fire-and-forget tasks serialized behind a per-channel lock, so ordering is preserved and the final persisted message always matches the final content. Adds `Conversation.wait_for_pending_syncs()`, drained on agent shutdown so in-flight writes are not dropped.

### `anam` plugin: Anam SDK 0.6.0

The Anam avatar plugin now depends on `anam>=0.6.0,<0.7` (was `>=0.3.0,<0.4`). Sessions use the SDK's direct API-key path and default `video_quality="high"`; the plugin API is unchanged.

## Bug Fixes

### `speechify` plugin: set `Speechify-Caller` attribution header

`speechify.TTS` now passes `Speechify-Caller: vision-agents` on every request to the Speechify API, so usage from this plugin is attributed correctly instead of showing up unattributed.

### `twelvelabs` plugin: asset ready wait and clip duration for Pegasus (#610)

`PegasusVLM` now polls the TwelveLabs Assets API until an uploaded clip is `ready` before `analyze_stream` — direct uploads return `processing` and must not be analyzed early. Encoded MP4 clips also set PTS/`time_base` so padded buffers report at least 4 seconds of duration (Pegasus's minimum). Uploaded assets are still deleted if ready-wait fails or times out.

### `openai` plugin: `ChatCompletionsLLM` ignored injected/eager turn text and leaked `<think>` reasoning

`ChatCompletionsLLM.simple_response` rebuilt the request purely from the conversation and ignored its `text` argument unless `participant` was `None`. Because the agent always supplies a participant, injected `agent.simple_response()` instructions produced an empty request (`400 chat content is empty`), and eager turns answered the *previous* transcript. The current `text` is now appended as the trailing user message when the conversation does not already end with it. Additionally, `<think>...</think>` reasoning spans emitted by reasoning models (e.g. MiniMax-M3) are now stripped from streamed deltas and final text so they no longer reach chat or TTS.

### `gemini` plugin: crash on duplicate follow-up tool calls (#588)

`GeminiLLM.simple_response` crashed with `ValueError('content parts are required.')` when the model echoed an already-executed function call in a follow-up turn. `_dedup_and_execute` filtered it out, leaving the follow-up `chat.send_message_stream(parts=[], ...)` with an empty list, which google-genai rejects. The multi-hop loop now exits cleanly when every requested call is a duplicate.

# v0.6.2

## Breaking Changes

### `heygen` plugin removed (#563)

The `heygen` plugin, deprecated in v0.6.0 (#553), is now removed. Use
`vision_agents.plugins.liveavatar.Avatar` instead — it targets the same product via the supported LITE-mode integration path.

Three internal events used only by the `heygen` plugin (`LLMResponseChunkEvent`, `LLMResponseCompletedEvent`, `RealtimeAgentSpeechTranscriptionEvent`) were also removed from
`vision_agents.core.llm.events`.

### Unified plugin lifecycle via `Component` base class (#578)

`LLM`, `STT`, `TTS`, `TurnDetector`, `EdgeTransport`, `Avatar` and `Processor` now inherit from a new
`vision_agents.core.base.Component` base, which defines a uniform `start()` / `close()` lifecycle (both default to no-ops; subclasses override what they need).

Concrete shape changes for out-of-tree plugins:

- **`TurnDetector.stop` is renamed to `close`.** Plugins that subclassed `TurnDetector` and overrode `stop()` must rename the override; the agent no longer invokes `stop`. The base classes for vogent and smart_turn turn detectors were migrated in this release.
- `Processor` and `EdgeTransport` no longer redeclare `close` as `@abstractmethod` — the abstract contract now comes from `Component`. Existing implementations that override `close` keep working unchanged.
- `Component` inherits from `ABC` and keeps `ABCMeta`, so subclasses can continue to declare their own `@abstractmethod`s.

## New Features

### Python 3.14 support (#582)

`agents-core` and every plugin except `kokoro`, `smart_turn`, and `vogent` now advertise Python 3.14 support. `kokoro` and `smart_turn` pin `numpy<2.3`, which conflicts with `getstream[webrtc]`'s `numpy>=2.3.2` on 3.14. `vogent` pulls `vogent-turn==0.1.1`, which pins `onnxruntime-gpu==1.22.*` on Linux/Windows x86_64, and that has no `cp314` wheels.

Bumps the minimum `getstream` to `>=3.4.0` — the first release containing the Python 3.14 wheel-availability fix (https://github.com/GetStream/stream-py/pull/253).

### Faster agent startup via parallel component lifecycle (#578)

`Agent.join()` now starts every component concurrently (`asyncio.gather`) instead of stacking their network connects one after another. On a realistic setup
(Gemini LLM + ElevenLabs STT + Deepgram TTS + vogent + LemonSlice avatar) this cuts the lifecycle phase of `join()` from **~4.3 s to ~2.4 s (≈45% faster, ~1.9 s saved)**;
the remaining time is the single slowest component (here, the LemonSlice RTC connect).

Error handling is asymmetric and explicit:

- **Startup is fail-fast.** If any component's `start()` raises, the failure is logged with the component class name, in-flight siblings are cancelled and awaited so no
  half-open network connects leak, and `agent.join()` re-raises so the agent doesn't run half-initialised.
- **Shutdown is best-effort.** A failing `close()` is logged via `log_exceptions` and swallowed so the remaining components still get a chance to release resources.

Plugin authors: because lifecycle hooks now run concurrently, components must not assume sibling ordering during `start` / `close`. Audio and video frames are still dispatched to processors in list order.

### Friendlier `vision-agents init` errors (#579)

`vision-agents init` without an agent name now prints a message that says what's missing and shows an example, instead of Click's bare `Missing argument 'NAME'.`. The
positional argument is renamed `AGENT_NAME` and documented in `--help`.

### Richer `vision-agents init` scaffold (#581)

Scaffolded projects now ship with a `tests/` directory backed by `vision_agents.testing` (`TestSession`, `LLMJudge`, multi-turn example) and pytest configured in `pyproject.toml`, plus a `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for deployment. The README and the "next steps" hint switch from `uv run vision-agents agent run` to `uv run agent.py run` — same dispatch, but the command now mirrors what's in `agent.py` so the entrypoint is the file you actually edit.

## Bug Fixes

- **Packaging**: stop double-packing CLI templates into the wheel — `hatchling` already includes the `.j2` files via the `packages` entry, so the extra `force-include` wrote each template twice and triggered `UserWarning: Duplicate name` during builds. (#571)
- **Gemini default model**: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` was decommissioned upstream; replaced with `gemini-flash-lite-latest` in defaults, examples, tests, and docs. (#583)
- **`smart_turn` and `vogent` `requires-python` raised to `>=3.11`**: both depend on `onnxruntime>=1.24.3`, which has no `cp310` wheels, so the previous `>=3.10` metadata was broken — a 3.10 install would fail at resolution time. (#582)

# v0.6.1

## Breaking Changes

### Event types cleanup (#552)

Follow-up to the v0.6.0 inference-pipeline rewrite (#501).
The events that used to carry audio / transcript / turn payloads are gone — that data now flows through
`Stream[T]` outputs on STT, TTS, LLM, and Realtime. Only lifecycle / notification events remain on the event bus.

Removed event classes:

- `vision_agents.core.agents.events`: `AgentInitEvent`, `AgentSayEvent`, `AgentSayStartedEvent`, `AgentSayCompletedEvent`, `AgentSayErrorEvent`.
- `vision_agents.core.stt.events`: `STTTranscriptEvent`, `STTPartialTranscriptEvent`, `STTConnectionEvent`, `TranscriptResponse`.
- `vision_agents.core.tts.events`: `TTSAudioEvent`.
- `vision_agents.core.turn_detection.events`: `TurnStartedEvent`, `TurnEndedEvent` (the module itself was deleted — turn boundaries are now `TurnStarted` /
  `TurnEnded` items on the STT / `TurnDetector` output stream, plus the new `UserTurnStartedEvent` / `UserTurnEndedEvent` below).
- `vision_agents.core.llm.events`: `RealtimeAudioInputEvent`, `RealtimeAudioOutputEvent`, `RealtimeAudioOutputDoneEvent`, `RealtimeResponseEvent`, `RealtimeConversationItemEvent`,
  `RealtimeErrorEvent`, `LLMRequestStartedEvent`, `RealtimeUserSpeechTranscriptionEvent`, `VLMInferenceStartEvent`, `VLMInferenceCompletedEvent`, `VLMErrorEvent`.
- `vision_agents.core.events`: `ConnectionState` enum.

Field changes:

- `RealtimeDisconnectedEvent.was_clean` → `clean`.
- `provider` field removed from `RealtimeConnectedEvent` and `RealtimeDisconnectedEvent` (`plugin_name` already identifies the source).
- `retry_count` and `is_recoverable` removed from `STTErrorEvent`.

## New Features

### `vision-agents` CLI with `init` and `agent` commands (#533, #567, #568)

Adds a console script with two subcommands. `uvx vision-agents init <name>` scaffolds a new agent project (`pyproject.toml`, `agent.py`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`,
`README.md`) and runs `uv sync` to provision a venv (skip with `--no-install`). `vision-agents agent run|serve` reads `[tool.vision-agents.agent].entrypoint` (gunicorn-style
`module:attribute`, e.g. `"agent:runner"`) from the project's `pyproject.toml`, imports it in-process and dispatches to its
`Runner.cli()`. No subprocess, no uv dependency at runtime — just install the CLI in the same env as the project (typically via
`uv run` or an activated venv). Templates are rendered with Jinja2 and default to a `gemini.Realtime` agent driven through `agent.simple_response(...)` to match the quickstart.

### New high-level agent events (#552)

New lifecycle events on the agent's own bus, suitable for application code (versus the plugin-level events that come and go with internals):

- `AgentJoinedCallEvent`, `AgentLeftCallEvent` — agent call membership.
- `UserTurnStartedEvent`, `UserTurnEndedEvent` — user speech turn boundaries.
- `UserTranscriptEvent` — final user transcript that triggers an LLM turn.
- `AgentTurnStartedEvent`, `AgentTurnEndedEvent` — agent speech turn boundaries (`interrupted` flag on the end event for barge-in).

Also adds plugin-side `STTConnectedEvent` / `STTDisconnectedEvent`, `TTSConnectedEvent` / `TTSDisconnectedEvent` / `TTSErrorEvent`, and
`LLMResponseFinalEvent` to replace the connection-state and realtime-response events removed above.

## Bug Fixes

- **Optional `redis` extra**: importing `vision_agents.core` no longer emits a `UserWarning` when the
  `redis` package is absent. The warning was noise for the majority of users who don't use `RedisSessionKVStore`; instead, attempting to import
  `vision_agents.core.agents.session_registry.redis_store` directly raises a `ModuleNotFoundError` with an actionable install hint ("
  `pip install 'vision-agents[redis]'`"), matching the FastAPI optional-extra pattern. (#562)
- **AWS Realtime**: stop hanging on disconnect — the receive loop now exits cleanly when the upstream event stream returns
  `None` instead of crashing on the next field access. (#569)
- **Gemini Realtime**: fix missing user-speech start/end signals. The previous implementation listened on Gemini Live's `voice_activity_detection_signal` /
  `voice_activity` channels, which are allowlist-only and silent for most accounts, so `RealtimeUserSpeechStarted` /
  `RealtimeUserSpeechEnded` never fired. Boundaries are now derived from `input_transcription` (start) and `model_turn` /
  `tool_call` (end), and the per-turn flags reset on session re-establishment so a mid-utterance reconnect doesn't inherit stale state. (#569)
- **OpenAI Realtime**: fix `RealtimeUserSpeechStarted` / `RealtimeUserSpeechEnded` not being emitted when audio is pushed via
  `simple_audio_response()` — the current participant is now stored on that path. Also switches the user-turn-end signal from
  `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` (server_vad-only) to `input_audio_buffer.committed`, so semantic-VAD sessions also see the end-of-turn event. (#569)
- **LiveAvatar**: include the plugin README in the PyPI package; fix casing in the heygen plugin README and link to the LiveAvatar PyPI page. (#564)

# v0.6.0

## Breaking Changes

### Agent inference pipeline rewrite (#501)

Large internal refactor of the agent's audio/LLM/TTS pipeline (~10k LOC across ~195 files). The orchestration that used to live inside `Agent` is now an explicit
`InferenceFlow` abstraction with two implementations — `TranscribingInferenceFlow` (STT → LLM → TTS) and `RealtimeInferenceFlow` (speech-to-speech).

Data flow between components is driven by a new generic `Stream[T]` primitive (with backpressure, `clear()` and `close()`) instead of plugin events:
`LLM.simple_response` now returns an `AsyncIterator[LLMResponseDelta | LLMResponseFinal]`, and `STT`, `TTS`, `TurnDetector`, and `Realtime` expose
`.output` streams that consumers iterate. The `MetricsCollector` was rewritten to a direct
`on_*()` API with parent/child merging so plugin metrics fan in to the agent root and OpenTelemetry is written exactly once. Turn lifecycle is now managed by a dedicated
`LLMTurn` class with explicit `confirm` / `cancel` / `finalize` steps.

#### Migration

`agent.llm.simple_response(...)` → `agent.simple_response(...)`:

```python
# Before
await agent.llm.simple_response("greet the user")

# After
await agent.simple_response("greet the user")
```

`LLM.simple_response` is now an async iterator, not event-driven:

```python
# Before — listen for chunks/completed events
@agent.events.subscribe
async def on_chunk(event: LLMResponseChunkEvent): ...


@agent.events.subscribe
async def on_done(event: LLMResponseCompletedEvent): ...


# After — iterate the response stream
async for item in llm.simple_response("hello"):
    if isinstance(item, LLMResponseDelta):
        print(item.delta, end="")
    elif isinstance(item, LLMResponseFinal):
        print("\n[done]", item.text)
```

`streaming_tts` is gone — TTS always streams sentence-by-sentence via the new `TTSSentenceTokenizer`:

```python
# Before
agent = Agent(..., streaming_tts=True)

# After — remove the flag
agent = Agent(...)
```

Turn-detection events on the bus are replaced by `TurnStarted` / `TurnEnded` items on the STT / `TurnDetector` output stream (`TurnEvent` enum removed).

#### Other breakages

- `Agent.simple_audio_response()` removed; speech-to-speech is now handled by `RealtimeInferenceFlow`.
- `TTSErrorEvent` and `TTSConnectionEvent` removed; TTS errors are surfaced through metrics (`MetricsCollector.on_tts_error`).
- `MetricsCollector` no longer subscribes to plugin events — plugins call `metrics.on_*()` directly. Custom metric consumers that listened for
  `LLMResponseCompletedEvent` etc. must read from `agent.metrics` or merge into the collector tree.
- Plugin author API: `TTS.send()` removed, replaced by `TTS.send_iter(stream)` which consumes a `Stream[TTSInput | TTSInputEnd]` and produces a `Stream[TTSOutputChunk]`.
  `set_output_format()` is also gone — output format is fixed by the inference flow.
- Plugin-specific event types removed from `aws`, `gemini`, `huggingface`, `nvidia`, `openai`, and `xai`. Data that used to ride on those events now flows through the standard
  `LLMResponseDelta` / `LLMResponseFinal` stream items.

### Avatar plugin API (#534)

Avatars are now a first-class plugin type with their own kwarg on `Agent(...)` rather than being passed through the generic
`processors=[...]` list. The existing publisher classes have been removed in favour of an `Avatar` symbol exported from each plugin.

- `anam.AnamAvatarPublisher` removed. Use `anam.Avatar`.
- `lemonslice.LemonSliceAvatarPublisher` removed. Use `lemonslice.Avatar`.
- `liveavatar.Avatar` is new in this release and uses the new API (see New Features below).
- `heygen.AvatarPublisher` is unchanged — the `heygen` plugin keeps the legacy `processors=[...]` wiring for this release and is scheduled for removal (#553). New code should use
  `liveavatar.Avatar` instead.
- `vision_agents.core.utils.av_synchronizer` moved to `vision_agents.core.avatars.av_synchronizer` (also re-exported from `vision_agents.core.avatars`).

Migration:

```python
# Before
from vision_agents.plugins.anam import AnamAvatarPublisher

agent = Agent(..., processors=[AnamAvatarPublisher(...)])

# After
from vision_agents.plugins import anam

agent = Agent(..., avatar=anam.Avatar(...))
```

### EventManager (#555)

`core.events.EventManager` was simplified: events now dispatch immediately on `send()` (one
`asyncio.Task` per matching handler) instead of going through an internal deque and a background
`_process_events_loop`. This eliminates the "task was destroyed but is pending" warnings that appeared when an `EventManager` was garbage-collected.

- `EventManager.stop()` removed. Use `await EventManager.shutdown()` for teardown.
- `send()` calls after `shutdown()` are silently dropped.
- Tests that relied on observing the internal queue should switch to `await events.wait()`.

### ElevenLabs STT class rename (#559)

The internal class `STT` was renamed to `ElevenlabsSTT` to make it searchable. The public import path is unchanged —
`from vision_agents.plugins.elevenlabs import STT` still works via re-export.

## New Features

### Public API on `Agent` (#501)

| Member                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `await agent.simple_response(text, participant=None, interrupt=True)` | Inject an instruction for the LLM to respond to. Replaces `agent.llm.simple_response(...)`. Routed through the active `InferenceFlow`.        |
| `await agent.say(text, interrupt=False)`                              | Speak text directly through TTS, bypassing the LLM. New `interrupt` flag preempts an in-flight turn and clears the TTS pipeline.              |
| `agent.resolve_inference_flow() -> InferenceFlow`                     | Extension point: picks `RealtimeInferenceFlow` for `Realtime` LLMs, otherwise `TranscribingInferenceFlow`. Override to plug in a custom flow. |

### Public utilities under `vision_agents.core` (#501)

- `core.utils.stream.Stream[T]` — generic async producer/consumer queue with `send` / `get` / `clear` / `close` / `collect(timeout)` / `peek()`.
- `core.utils.tokenizer.TTSSentenceTokenizer` — sentence chunker used to feed TTS incrementally.
- `core.agents.inference` — `InferenceFlow`, `TranscribingInferenceFlow`, `RealtimeInferenceFlow`, `AudioInputStream`, `AudioOutputStream`, `AudioInputChunk`, `AudioOutputChunk`,
  `AudioOutputFlush`.
- `core.observability.MetricsCollector.merge(child)` — hierarchical metrics merging so child collectors forward to a parent without duplicating OTel writes.

### LLM interruption API (#501)

`await llm.interrupt()` is now part of the public
`LLM` contract. The active inference flow calls it to preempt an in-flight response (e.g. on a barge-in); plugin authors must implement it.

### Dedicated Avatar plugin type (#534)

`Agent(...)` accepts a new
`avatar=` keyword argument. The avatar owns the agent's outbound video/audio tracks, and the inference flow's audio output is routed through the avatar provider for lipsync. Plugin authors can build new integrations by subclassing
`vision_agents.core.avatars.Avatar`.

```python
from vision_agents.plugins import anam

agent = Agent(..., avatar=anam.Avatar(...))
```

### LiveAvatar plugin (#534)

New first-party avatar plugin:
`vision_agents.plugins.liveavatar.Avatar` — LiveAvatar (by HeyGen) integration over WebRTC + websocket. Recommended replacement for the now-deprecated `heygen` plugin.

Install with: `uv add "vision-agents[liveavatar]"`

### HeyGen plugin scheduled for removal (#553)

The `heygen` plugin will be removed in a future release in favour of `liveavatar`.

### Tencent TRTC plugin (#386)

New
`vision_agents.plugins.tencent` edge transport for Tencent TRTC (WebRTC). Wraps Tencent's manylinux-only
`liteav` SDK and is gated by `sys_platform == 'linux'` in both `vision-agents[tencent]` and `vision-agents[all-plugins]` — non-Linux installs silently skip it.

Install with: `uv add "vision-agents[tencent]"`

Required env vars: `TENCENT_SDK_APP_ID`, `TENCENT_SDK_SECRET_KEY`. Optional: `TENCENT_TRTC_SCENE`, `TENCENT_LITEAV_DEBUG`.

## Breaking Changes

### Built-in HTTP server

#### API Endpoints

All session endpoints now include `call_id` as a path parameter:

| Before                               | After                                                |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `POST /sessions`                     | `POST /calls/{call_id}/sessions`                     |
| `DELETE /sessions/{session_id}`      | `DELETE /calls/{call_id}/sessions/{session_id}`      |
| `POST /sessions/{session_id}/close`  | `POST /calls/{call_id}/sessions/{session_id}/close`  |
| `GET /sessions/{session_id}`         | `GET /calls/{call_id}/sessions/{session_id}`         |
| `GET /sessions/{session_id}/metrics` | `GET /calls/{call_id}/sessions/{session_id}/metrics` |

#### Request Body

- `call_id` removed from `POST /sessions` request body — now a URL path parameter

#### Response Codes

- `DELETE /calls/{call_id}/sessions/{session_id}` now returns **202 Accepted** (was 204)
- `POST /calls/{call_id}/sessions/{session_id}/close` now returns **202 Accepted** (was 200)
- Session closure is now asynchronous — the owning node processes the close request on its next maintenance cycle

#### ServeOptions

- `get_current_user` option removed
- Permission callbacks (`can_start_session`, `can_close_session`, `can_view_session`, `can_view_metrics`) now receive `call_id: str` as a parameter

#### Removed Dependencies

- `vision_agents.core.runner.http.dependencies.get_session` removed
- `vision_agents.core.runner.http.dependencies.get_current_user` removed

### FunctionRegistry

- `register_function()` now rejects synchronous functions with `ValueError` — all registered functions must be async (#373)
- `FunctionRegistry.call_function()` and `LLM.call_function()` are now `async` (#373)

### Agent authentication

- `Agent.create_user()` renamed to `Agent.authenticate()` (#380)
- `EdgeTransport.create_user()` renamed to `EdgeTransport.authenticate()` (#380)
- Authentication is now called automatically during `Agent.start()` — manual calls are no longer needed (#380)

### Testing

- `mock_tools()` and standalone `mock_functions()` removed from `vision_agents.testing` (#376)
- Use `TestSession.mock_functions()` instead

### AgentLauncher

- `cleanup_interval` parameter renamed to `maintenance_interval` (#374)
- `created_by` parameter removed from `start_session()` (#374)
- `AgentSession.created_by` field removed (#374)
- `call_id` values must match `^[a-z0-9_-]+$` (raises `InvalidCallId`) (#374)
- New parameter: `registry: SessionRegistry | None = None` (#374)

## New Features

### Redis-backed Agent session registry for horizontal scaling

Sessions are shared across nodes via Redis, enabling cross-node session queries and closure without sticky sessions. (#374)

```python
from vision_agents.core import AgentLauncher, Runner
from vision_agents.core.agents.session_registry import RedisSessionKVStore, SessionRegistry

store = RedisSessionKVStore(url="redis://localhost:6379")
registry = SessionRegistry(store=store)
runner = Runner(AgentLauncher(create_agent=create_agent, join_call=join_call, registry=registry))
```

Install with: `uv add "vision-agents[redis]"`

**New public API on AgentLauncher:**

| Method                                       | Description                            |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `get_session_info(call_id, session_id)`      | Query session info from shared storage |
| `request_close_session(call_id, session_id)` | Request closure from any node          |

**Custom store backends:** `SessionKVStore` is an abstract class that can be subclassed to support any TTL key-value store (DynamoDB, Memcached, etcd, etc.).

### PEP 561 compliance

`py.typed` markers added to `vision_agents.core` and `vision_agents.testing` for downstream type checking support. (#378)

## Bug Fixes

- **EventManager**: fix crash when event handlers have return type annotations (#381)
- **RedisSessionKVStore**: fix import error when `redis` package is not installed (#384)
- **Agent metrics**: fix metrics storage and serialization in session registry (#387)
